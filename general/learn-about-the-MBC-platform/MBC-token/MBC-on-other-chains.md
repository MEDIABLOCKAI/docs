# Crypto Media Network on Other Chains

Interoperability with other major blockchains is important for the growth of Crypto Media Network Coin and the prospects of realizing its vision. One of the ways of securing it is through enabling the versions (wrappers) of Crypto Media Network on other chains.&#x20;

Unlinke Crypto Media Network on Crypto Media Network Coin, those wrappers are Crypto Media Network20 tokens are created whenever someone locks a certain number of tokens on the Crypto Media Network Coin and gets issued the exact same amount of wrapper tokens on the target blockchain. If a user withdraws the wrapper from the target blockchain, the tokens burned and the Crypto Media Network tokens on Crypto Media Network Coin are unlocked.&#x20;

Currently, wrapped versions of Crypto Media Network token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.&#x20;
