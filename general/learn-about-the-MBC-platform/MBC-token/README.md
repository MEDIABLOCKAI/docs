# Crypto Media Network Coin Token (Crypto Media Network)

The Crypto Media Network token is the native currency of the Crypto Media Network Coin blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## Crypto Media Network utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Crypto Media Network Coin blockchain, Crypto Media Network is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Crypto Media Network Coin to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.cmnscan.com/](https://status.cmnscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked Crypto Media Network. Which means validators with higher amounts of Crypto Media Network Coin staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any Crypto Media Network holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of Crypto Media Network they wish. They receive a share of the Crypto Media Network Coin block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As Crypto Media Network is the native currency on Crypto Media Network Coin, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, Crypto Media Network transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of Crypto Media Network tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Crypto Media Network Coin platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
