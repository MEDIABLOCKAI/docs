# Media Block Network Coin: Ethereum â†” Media Block Network Coin

Media Block Network Coin native bridge between Ethereum and Media Block Network Coin is used to relay the Media Block Network Coin native token from Media Block Network Coin to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Media Block Network Coin bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Media Block Network Coin tokens between the Media Block Network Coin chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Media Block Network Coin or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Media Block Network Coin tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Media Block Network Coin chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Media Block Network Coin chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Media Block Network Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Media Block Network Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On Media Block Network Coin you send native Media Block Network Coin token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Media Block Network Coin token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Media Block Network Coin token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Media Block Network Coin native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
